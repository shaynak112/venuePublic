             <p><img src='images/wellness/pic1.png' style='width:15%;display:inline-block;padding:5px;float:left;'><strong>Breakfast Club</strong> is a biweekly event on Wednesday mornings at 6 AM. Hosted by Ticky Ty as well as other local DJs (such as Miz Megs and Joee Cons) as well as fitness instructors. People come to dance and exercise in the morning to get pumped up for the day whle listening to live music.</p><br/><br/>

             <p><img src='images/wellness/pic5.jpg' style='width:20%;display:inline-block;padding:5px;float:right;'>Hula hooping classes are weekly on Thursday nights for both beginners and intermediate level. The beginner classes start out with the basics and the intermediate classes are more advanced and have additional tricks. Class size is limited so be sure to sign up for the next session right away. These classes often sell out.</p><br/><br/>
